slstatus - suckless status
==========================
slstatus is a suckless status monitor for window managers that use WM_NAME
(e.g. dwm) or stdin to fill the status bar.

This is the version of slstatus that I actually use.
It has all of the functions and files that I don't need removed.
Any features that this branch has are also merged into master.

Features
--------
- CPU usage
- Date and time
- Kernel version
- Network speeds (RX and TX)
- Memory status (total memory and used memory)
- Uptime


Requirements
------------
Currently slstatus works on Linux.
In order to build slstatus you need the Xlib header files.

Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (slstatus is installed into the
/usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install slstatus (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running slstatus
----------------
See the man page for details.


Configuration
-------------
slstatus can be customized by creating a custom config.h and (re)compiling the
source code. This keeps it fast, secure and simple.
